# Blockchain-Project

To start the project, first move in the correct directory with 
``` 
cd Scholarship-master
```
Then install the necessary dependencies
```
npm install
```
To run the backend server, in the ScholarshipServer directory, execute:
```
npm run start
```
To run the Angular frontend, in the ScholarshipFrontend directory, execute:
```
npm run start
```
To make the whole system run properly, we need to run a local Ganache instance on the port 7545.
Then, in the web browser, we must link MetaMask to run on the Local Ethereum Network, rather than other public Blockchain.

The Web Application will be available on the local address: http://localhost:4200
